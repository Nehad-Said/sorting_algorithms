About this project:
In this project I learnt and practiced;

What is the Big O notation, and how to evaluate the time complexity of an algorithm
How to select the best sorting algorithm for a given input
What is a stable sorting algorithm
I went ahead to implement 12 different sorting algorithms in 12 files.
